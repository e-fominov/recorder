# We can have manu video sources here
sources:
  # video source name should be simple, it will be used in naming the files

    #show: false

    #profile: default
profiles:
  # profile defines how the data is encoded
  default:
    # default frame rate is 30 fps. if source really produces 15 fps or rome varying frame rate,
    # it will be transformed to a constant 30 fps frame rate with duplicating missing frames
    # and dropping extra frames. this ensures stream consistency
    #framerate: 30/1
    # capture stream size. Only makes sense for test video source
    #width: 640
    # capture stream height. Only makes sense for test video source

    # you can disable clock by uncommenting the following line:
